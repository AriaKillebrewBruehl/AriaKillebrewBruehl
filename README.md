Hello! I'm @AriaKillebrewBruehl (Aria Killebrew Bruehl)! I'm a current sophomore at Reed College majoring in computer science and minoring in French. 

I have completed CSCI 121 and CSCI 221 (Computer Science Fundamentals I and II) and am currently taking CSCI 3897 (Computing and Complexity) at Reed. I have also 
completed Data Structures and Algorithms at University of California Berkeley Extension. 

I am currently looking for any opportunities to grow as a programmer and computer scientist and to refine my areas of interest.
