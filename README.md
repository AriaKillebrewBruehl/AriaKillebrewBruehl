Hello! I'm @AriaKillebrewBruehl (Aria Killebrew Bruehl)! I'm a current junior at Reed College majoring in computer science and minoring in French. 

I have completed Computer Science Fundamentals I and II (which I now TA for), Computing and Complexity, Cryptography, Fundametals of Programming Languages, Discrete Mathematics, and Linear Algrebra. I am currently taking Computer Systems and Computer Networks at Reed. I have also completed Data Structures and Algorithms at University of California Berkeley Extension. 

I am looking for any opportunities to grow as a programmer and computer scientist and to refine my areas of interest.
